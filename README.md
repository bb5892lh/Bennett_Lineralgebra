1. In this project, I use colab in order to solve homework problems that we were given in class. In this example, I also show step by step instructions on how I solved the problems.

2. In this project, I use a range of numbers from o to 255 on a color scale using matrices to unvale a secret picture. You can see early on that you can dectect the picture using a very low setting.

3. In this project, I worked with a group using colab in order to figure out a "secret number" that another grouo in our linear algebra class. We also tried to find the other groups number.
